        <h2>About Developer Guide</h2>
        <p>
          Developer Guide is an interactive reference platform designed to
          assist developers in quickly recalling the functionality of React
          hooks, methods, styling techniques, and more. This application is part
          of a web development course project I am participating in. I aimed to
          gather essential information for learning programming languages and
          technologies necessary for web development. Initially, I decided to
          create a useful guide for learning React, including hooks, custom
          hooks, components, and related bibliography. It also includes links to
          the official React documentation.

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          The main objective of Developer Guide is to provide a central hub for
          learning and recalling React components and hooks. This guide aims to
          offer clear and concise documentation accompanied by practical
          examples. By using this guide, users can quickly copy and implement
          code snippets, enhancing their coding efficiency. Additionally, the
          guide supports continuous learning by regularly updating the content
          to stay current with the latest React developments. Furthermore, the
          application provides practical exercises to enhance learning and
          application of React concepts.
