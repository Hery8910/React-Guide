      "subtitle": "Understanding the Benefits of Custom Hooks",
      "description": "Custom hooks in React allow you to extract and reuse logic that is shared across multiple components. By encapsulating complex logic within custom hooks, you can create cleaner, more maintainable, and modular code. Custom hooks also promote the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, ensuring that your application remains scalable and easier to understand. The best practice is to use custom hooks when you find yourself duplicating logic across components or when you want to abstract away complex behaviors."

        "title": "Fetching Data Efficiently",
        "description": "The `useFetch` hook is designed to simplify data fetching in React applications. It handles the logic for fetching data from an API, managing loading and error states, and returning the data for use in components.",
        "benefits": "This hook abstracts the complexity of using `fetch` or other data-fetching methods in multiple components, allowing you to avoid code repetition. It also makes your components cleaner by separating the data-fetching logic.",
        "implementation": "import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction useFetch(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        setData(data);\n        setLoading(false);\n      })\n      .catch(error => {\n        setError(error);\n        setLoading(false);\n      });\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n```"

        "description": "The `useLocalStorage` hook is used to simplify the process of reading from and writing to the browserâ€™s local storage. This hook abstracts the logic needed to work with local storage and provides an easy API for interacting with it.",
        "benefits": "This hook enables you to persist data across sessions without manually handling local storage interactions in every component. It also keeps your codebase clean by centralizing storage logic.",
        "implementation": "import { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {\n  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {\n    try {\n      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);\n      return item ?

        "title": "Controlling Function Execution Frequency",
        "description": "The `useDebounce` hook allows you to delay the execution of a function until after a specified time has passed since the last time it was invoked. This is particularly useful for scenarios like search inputs where you want to limit the frequency of API calls.",
        "benefits": "This hook helps in optimizing performance by reducing the number of function executions, particularly in cases where functions are triggered by user input events like typing.",
        "implementation": "import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction useDebounce(value, delay) {\n  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handler = setTimeout(() => {\n      setDebouncedValue(value);\n    }, delay);\n\n    return () => {\n      clearTimeout(handler);\n    };\n  }, [value, delay]);\n\n  return debouncedValue;\n}\n```"

        "title": "Tracking the Previous State",
        "description": "The `usePrevious` hook helps you keep track of the previous value of a state variable. This can be useful for comparing current and past state values to determine how your componentâ€™s behavior should change.",
        "benefits": "This hook simplifies state comparisons by automatically storing the previous state, eliminating the need for manual state management logic in your components.",
        "implementation": "import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\n\nfunction usePrevious(value) {\n  const ref = useRef();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ref.current = value;\n  }, [value]);\n\n  return ref.current;\n}\n```"
